# Web3 Glossary

## 51% attack or majority attack

an attack on a blockchain made possible when a single person or group gains control of over 50% of a blockchain's hashing power, enabling them to block new transactions from being confirmed as well as change the ordering of new transactions. It also allows the malicious agents to essentially rewrite parts of the blockchain and reverse their own transactions, leading to an issue known as double spending. (CoinDesk)

## abi

In computer software, an application binary interface (ABI) is an interface between two binary program modules. Often, one of these modules is a library or operating system facility, and the other is a program that is being run by a user.

## airdrop

a distribution of a cryptocurrency token or an asset like an NFT, usually for free, to numerous wallet addresses. Airdrops are primarily implemented as a way of gaining attention and new followers, resulting in a larger user-base and a wider disbursement of coins. (Wikipedia)

## apes

typically referring to the popular Bored Apes Yacht Club NFT project, \"apes\" has also become a slang term to refer to NFTs in general (regardless of what they depict)

## audit

a process in which an individual or company checks a blockchain-based project for flaws in its code, as well as tries to determine the legitimacy of the project based on other factors (identity of its creators, etc.)

## blockchain

a blockchain is a type of distributed database that is often decentralized across many different servers. Entries can be added to a blockchain, but typically can\'t be changed or erased without enormous difficulty and disruption to the network. There are many different blockchains; some of the best known include Bitcoin and Ethereum. (Wikipedia)

## bridge

a blockchain bridge is a method of allowing different blockchains to interoperate, allowing users to use tokens in a currency tied to one blockchain to operate on another.

## bug bounty

typically referred to funds distributed to ethical hackers in exchange for them privately disclosing software bugs to the company, crypto projects have taken to using the term \"bug bounty\" to also refer to ransom that is offered to hackers who have successfully stolen money, in exchange for them returning the funds and usually with promises that the affected platform won\'t seek prosecution

## burning

the process in which users remove tokens from circulation. This can apply to various assets including cryptocurrencies, where it is done to reduce the number of coins in circulation, or to NFTs, where it makes the NFT impossible to ever trade again. The process of burning involves sending the token to a wallet address that is unable to send tokens, permanently locking it there. (Investopedia)

## coin

a specific cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin)

## cold wallet

a cryptocurrency wallet that is not Internet-connected, in contrast to a \"hot wallet\"

## dApp / decentralized app

a computer application that runs on a decentralized computing system (Wikipedia)

## DeFi / decentralized finance

## double-spending

a potential flaw in a digital cash scheme in which the same single digital token can be spent more than once (Wikipedia)

## doxxing

discovering the identity of pseudonymous cryptocurrency traders, often those running a project. The term \"self-doxing\" is the process of disclosing one\'s own identity (often in hopes of lending legitimacy to a project). Projects where the developers\' identities are known are often described as \"fully-doxed\". In the crypto space, the term is not typically used with the negative meaning that it has elsewhere.

## Dutch auction

an auction which begins with a high asking price which lowers over a set time period until a buyer accepts the price, or a reserve price is hit (Wikipedia)

## DYOR (do your own research)

a common phrase in the crypto communities. Proponents would say that it is used to tell people they should verify everything themselves and not take advice from those who may not have their best interests in mind. Critics would point out that it\'s often used to dodge answering tricky questions, or imply someone doesn\'t know what they\'re talking about.

## fiat

government-issued legal tender---what most of us know as \"money\"

## flash loan

unsecured loans that don\'t require collateral from the borrower. Funds are borrowed, used, and returned all within one transaction, and they are typically used to provide leverage in arbitrage opportunities. They have also become a common entry point for hackers to exploit flaws in various DeFi protocols. (Radix)

## floor price

the lowest price at which any NFT in a collection can be bought

## fork

creating a new version of a blockchain or project based on an existing one. This is sometimes done when starting an entirely new project that is similar to one that already exists, to take advantage of the work that\'s already been done. It is also the term used when a blockchain needs to make a change to functionality, either to add new features or to fix security bugs---in this case, nodes must change over to the new version, or the chain will split into two separate chains with the same history, but different data going forward. (Wikipedia)

## freezing

a process in which a given exchange prevents an asset (such as an NFT) from being traded, usually because it has been identified as stolen. This also sometimes refers to the process of preventing an entire wallet from transacting on a platform. There is effectively no way for third parties to completely prevent a person from trading a specific asset, but when major exchanges freeze trading for an asset or wallet it makes it substantially harder for that asset to be sold or traded.

## FUD (fear/uncertainty/doubt)

a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear. Crypto projects often use the term more broadly to describe anything remotely negative about a project. (Wikipedia)

## Arbitrage

Making buy and sell transactions of the same asset at the same time and profiting from a difference in prices. Typically done across different markets, it is also possible to do by manipulating transaction ordering within the same block.

## Assert

In Solidity, assert(false) compiles to 0xfe, an invalid opcode, which uses up all remaining gas and reverts all changes. When an assert() statement fails, something very wrong and unexpected should be happening, and you will need to fix your code. You should use assert to avoid conditions which should never, ever occur.

## Back running

## Node

A software client that participates in the network.

## Nonce

In cryptography, a value that can only be used once. There are two types of nonce used in Ethereum. (1) An account nonce: A transaction counter in each account, which is used to prevent replay attacks.

## Private transaction

A transaction that bypassed the Ethereum transaction pool and was sent directly to miners.

## Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

Proof-of-Stake is a method by which a cryptocurrency blockchain protocol aims to achieve distributed consensus. Proof-of-Stake asks users to prove ownership of a certain amount of cryptocurrency (their \"stake\" in the network) in order to be able to participate in the validation of transactions.

## Proof-of-Work (PoW)

## Re-entrancy attack

An attack that consists of an Attacker contract calling a Victim contract function in such a way that during execution the Victim calls the Attacker contract again, recursively. This can result, for example, in the theft of funds by skipping parts of the Victim contract that update balances or count withdrawal amounts.

## Reward

An amount of ether included in each new block as a reward by the network to the miner who found the Proof-of-Work solution.

## Sandwich attack

The act of monitoring the transaction pool for a sufficiently valuable transaction (such as a large trade on a decentralized exchange), then submitting two transactions \'sandwiching\' the target transaction. The first one immediately before the target pushes price in one direction, while the second one immediately after the target does the opposite. The attacker profits from the arbitrage between their two transactions.
